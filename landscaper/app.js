// Banging my head against the wall here...
// Need your help here on how to actually start the game
// If I comment out the for loops the alerts start how I want
// Alerts disappear and don't start me off the way I want
// How do I prompt user to start game with new alert that activates for loop???
// Also, how do we get the alerts to go to the middle of the page?
